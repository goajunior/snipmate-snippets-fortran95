Snipmate.vim support for Fortran 95
===================================

This plugin provides some snippets
for writing Fortran 95 (and newer) code.

I tested this plugin against `garbas's Snipmate fork`_ and using Pathogen.
If it doesn't work with your own configuration, please let me know.

.. _garbas's Snipmate fork: https://github.com/garbas/vim-snipmate

Dependencies
------------
* Vim (of course)
* Snipmate_.

Installation
------------
This addon is compatible with Pathogen_ and Vundle_.
If you use one of them,
you are awesome so you'll know what to do.

I pretend to support installation with VAM_ as well,
but I haven't tried it.

If you are an old-fashioned Vimmer,
just drop the bib.snippets_ file
into the ``snippets`` directory
of your Snipmate install.
